MODULES

It is a part of program meaning divide the program into modules. Generally they are the regular functions we use in programming.
It keeps the units of code for a project neat and cleanly separated and organised.
Also Encapsulate some data into privacy.

e.g in our project there will be three kinds of module.

1.) UI MODULE
get input values
Add the new item to the UI
Update the UI

2.) DATA MODULE
add the new item to DS
Calculate budget

3.) CONTROLLER MODULE
Add event Handler.

We will use modules so that the variables can be made private and cannot be alterated by any other method or objects. Hence we will do data encapsulation
